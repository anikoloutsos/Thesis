Swarm Theory in the structural  organization of musical events: Applied in the case of guitar

Swarm intelligence is a subcategory of artificial intelligence, which constitutes an important part on the field of computer engineering. Blending artificial intelligence with music is still quite unusual, despite the fact that research in the field has progressed. Swarm intelligence shares some characteristics with improvised music, such as self-organizing, and therefore it is considered suited for music experimentation.
The aim of this thesis is to explore the possibilities offered through the interpretation of the concepts of swarm intelligence in music creation. Furthermore, the understanding of the novel structures and opportunities created through the interaction with a machine in a real time system, is considered of a high priority.

For this thesis an interface using Max/MSP/Jitter was developed, which allows human-computer interaction based on Swarm Theory.
The user can input live video and audio signals using the camera and microphone or use as input recorded video and audio. First of all the video is then analyzed in order to locate, using colors, the userâ€™s fingers.   Then the audio is analyzed in order to find the amplitude and main frequency. At least one swarm is assigned to every input and follows it according to the user specified characteristics of the swarm. Based on the ability to follow strictly or loosely each input, each swarm produces a new sound.
The application was tested using as audio sources recordings and live guitar and as video source a camera.
